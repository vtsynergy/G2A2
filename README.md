# G2A2: Graph Generator with Attributes and Anomalies

G2A2 is an automated <ins>g</ins>raph <ins>g</ins>enerator with <ins>a</ins>ttributes and <ins>a</ins>nomalies. It is a highly accurate, flexible, and scalable graph generator that can generate graphs with ground truth.

This repository contains code for G2A2 and a realistic graph library containing G2A2-generated social media graphs, article graphs, and Internet traffic graphs. The library
encompasses graphs with varying anomaly percentages, as well as different numbers of nodes and edges, providing researchers with a tool for benchmarking various algorithms.
